# Topic View
This is an app which allows a user to upload a CSV file, generate a topic model, and visually explore the results.

## End Users:
* **Data Scientists** - to perform initial topic exploration/ideation in preparation for detailed topic modeling.
* **Business Analysts** - to better understand topic clustering for segmenting customer behavior.
* **Business Stakeholders** - to begin understanding the main subjects/topics, and words customers are using.
